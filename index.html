        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Avery Holmes, a Lead HR Risk &amp; Governance professional at Fannie Mae and an
          Intelligence Officer in the Air National Guard, currently transitioning into software
          engineering through WVU’s MS in Software Engineering program. I build practical projects in
          Java and full-stack web development to strengthen my fundamentals, improve problem-solving,
          and ship reliable applications. My goal is to move into a front-end or full-stack role
          where I can apply disciplined systems thinking, clear communication, and execution under
          pressure to deliver high-impact software.
